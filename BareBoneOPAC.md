## Creating a Bare Bones OPAC
—
## Step 1: Creating the HTML Page and a PHP Search Page
To begin doing anything I need to log into my MySQL account ‘opener’
```
mysql -u opener -p
```
And then opened my opacdb file
```
Use opacdb;
```
Then to make sure that my copyright column uses the right rate style I run
```
update books set publication_date = str_to_date(concat(copyright, '-01-01'), '%Y-%m-%d');
alter table books drop column copyright;
 alter table books change publication_date copyright date not null;

## Step 2: HTML Form
Then I exit mysql with 
```
\q
``` 
And then change my directory to my html 
```
cd /var/www/html/
```
From here I use edit to enter into my mylibrary.html file
```
Sudo edit mylibrary.html
```
And then enter some HTML text into the file
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>MySQL Server Example</title>
    </head>
<body>

    <h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

    <p>In the form below, <b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
    Your search query will search by author, title, or publisher.
    Capitalization is usually not necessary on default case-insensitive MySQL collations.
    It's okay to enter partial information, like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

    <p>You can leave the search field empty and only enter dates.
    Regardless, both start and end dates are required for all searches.
    You can use the date fields to limit results, too.
    I added some extra records, which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

    <p><a href="opac.php">OPAC</a></p>

    <p>This is very much a toy, stripped down
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
    The records are basic.
    Not only do they not conform to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
    they don't even conform to something as simple as <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.</p>

    <p>I also don't provide options to select different fields, like author, title, or publisher fields.
    Instead the search field below searches key bibliographic fields (author, title, publisher) in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

    <p>The key idea is to get a sense of how an OPAC works, though.</p>

    <h2>My Basic Library OPAC</h2>

    <form method="post" action="search.php">
        <label for="search">Search Terms (optional):</label>
        <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
        
        <br>
        
        <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
        <input type="date" name="start_date" id="start_date" required>
        
        <br>
        
        <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
        <input type="date" name="end_date" id="end_date" required>
        
        <br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Search">
    </form>

</body>
</html>
```

## Step 3: PHP Search Script
Then I create a PHP file in the same directory titled search.php and enter some PHP coding
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Search Results</title>
<style>
    table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
        width: 100%;
    }
    th, td {
        border: 1px solid black;
        padding: 8px;
        text-align: left;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Search Results</h1>

    <?php
    // Load MySQL credentials
    require_once '/var/www/login.php';

    // Enable MySQL error reporting
    mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);

    // Establish connection
    $conn = new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $search = trim($_POST['search']);
        $start_date = $_POST['start_date'];
        $end_date = $_POST['end_date'];

        // Prepared statement to prevent SQL injection
        $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, author, title, publisher, copyright FROM books 
                                WHERE (author LIKE ? OR title LIKE ? OR publisher LIKE ?) 
                                AND copyright BETWEEN ? AND ?");

        // Use wildcard search
        $search_param = "%$search%";
        $stmt->bind_param("sssss", $search_param, $search_param, $search_param, $start_date, $end_date);
        $stmt->execute();
        $result = $stmt->get_result();

        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
            echo "<table>";
            echo "<tr><th>ID</th><th>Author</th><th>Title</th><th>Publisher</th><th>Copyright</th></tr>";

            while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
                echo "<tr>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["id"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["author"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["title"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["publisher"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["copyright"]) . "</td>";
                echo "</tr>";
            }

            echo "</table>";
        } else {
            echo "<p>No results found.</p>";
        }

        $stmt->close();
    }

    $conn->close();
    ?>

    <p><a href="mylibrary.html">Return to search page</a></p>

</body>
</html>
```

## Step 4: Modifications
Then I log into my ‘opener’ account in mysql
```
mysql -u opener -p
```
Then I opened my opacdb file
```
Use opacdb;
```
And then threw in some of the data from my last few finished books such as 
```
insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Andy Weir', 'Project Hail Mary', 'Ballantine Books', '2021'),
('Martha Wells', 'Rogue Protocol', 'Tordotcom', '2018');

## Reflection
Once I was finished with this lesson I realized that the minor error I had been receiving the whole time was an actual issue. From what I can tell it was due to the information for the copyright column being too large for the cell. I eventually just shortened the date and if fixed things. I am now, however on table ‘books3’ instead of plain books. If that hadn’t happened I would have described this lesson as a breeze, as it is I continue to curse my luck with computers.
